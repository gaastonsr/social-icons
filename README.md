# Responsive Social Icons

By default they will render 40x40px each but you can easily override it with a super class. For example:

```css
.big-social-icons .social-icon {
    width: 120px;
    height: 120px;
}
```

And that's all, you don't need to worry for anything else, icons will resize accordingly. You can also make it square looking instead of the circle looking default:

```css
.square-social-icons .social-icon {
    border-radius: 10%;
}
```

Or even make them all one color

```css
.one-color-social-icons .social-icon {
    background-color: #091c30;
}
```
